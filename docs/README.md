#### Create and build modern JavaScript applications with zero initial configuration
#### Neutrino combines the power of Webpack with the simplicity of presets.

Neutrino is a companion tool which lets you build web and Node.js applications with shared presets or configurations. 
It intends to make the process of initializing and building projects much simpler by providing minimal development
dependencies.

Neutrino uses Webpack to build both web and Node.js projects by providing complete build presets which can be shared
across targets and projects. You can use Neutrino base presets to get started building a variety of projects, create
your own presets by extending the Neutrino core ones to be shared across your own projects or even by the community.
Presets can even be manipulated on a project-by-project basis to handle almost any build situation your preset doesn't
cover.
